    <summary>I'm 25 years old, living in Alberta, Canada.

I am a former flight instructor and digital educator who has always just played Overwatch for fun, and never really had any aspirations of becoming a pro player. However, I really enjoy helping both individuals and teams improve themselves, and decided to dedicate myself to the dream of becoming a Coach or Analyst in the OWL.

I will be streaming full-time starting in May 2018.

I am hyper competitive, passionate, and always seeking to improve myself - and if you want to learn the game or hone your skills, then I want to help you achieve those goals.</summary>

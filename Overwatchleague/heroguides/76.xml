    <title>GM / Top 500 | Soldier 76 Advanced Aim Training / Warmup Guide</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b"Hey guys, today I made a short video showing how I warm up before I play. The topics covered are below... \n\n1. Erratic Movement \n\nThe first thing I want to talk about is Erratic Movement. What I mean by this is to play as fast paced as possible, handicapping yourself to the point where it is extremely difficult to aim. One thing you should note is that your goal is not to hit every shot. In this drill it is perfectly okay not to have 100% accuracy. This will improve over time as you practice. Some things you can try are jumping, crouch spamming, or shooting a new target after killing the previous one as fast as humanly possible. \n\nNow this benefits you because once you put yourself in an actual game scenario, for the most part, you wont have to do these things. Everything will feel as if it were at a slower pace, and as time progresses you should feel as if it is easier for you to shoot targets and maintain a good weapon accuracy.. \n\nI usually do this for 3 to 5 minutes before moving on to our next subject, practicing without a HUD. \n\n\n2. Practicing Without a HUD\n \n The problem that a lot of players have is that they focus so much on their cross hair, they tend to lose track of the actual target they are shooting at. A simple way to work on fixing this while still improving your aim is to disable your HUD. \n\n If you are playing with default controls, or haven't changed your HUD key bind, you can turn it off with ALT-Z. \n\n With this turned off, you are relying more on muscle memory than an actual cross hair. If you think about it, if you can hit a target without having to use your HUD, you can do so much more with your cross hair re-enabled. \n\n The key is to practice doing this at different distances. Close range should be easy, medium slightly hindering, and at long distances it should be fairly difficult to kill a target in a single clip. As you practice, you should recognize that it gets easier to hit targets from all three distances. After you are comfortable, you can combine this drill, along with erratic movement to get the most beneficial training. \n\n I usually practice this for 3 to 5 minutes before moving onto our next subject, flickering. \n\n3. Flickering \n\n Flickering is a very simple drill that will build your muscle memory into allowing you to switch targets extremely fast. It will also help with the initial flick onto a target when you first see them. \n\n A simple way to do this is to straff in the direction that your next target is currently at. This will move your crosshair closer to them and minimize your chances of flicking to far to the left or two the right. Keep in mind, while it is a good idea to practice strafing, the point of the drill is to flick to them. The longer you practice this, the easier it will become to get the upper hand on your opponent. A good example of when you would need to use this is when you find yourself in a 1v2 situation, or when you come around a corner and the enemy DPS is right there to meet you.\n\nIf you become comfortable with this drill, it is beneficial to combine this drill with Erratic Movement, and No HUD. If you can combine these other drills successfully, your aim will naturally become better over time. \n\nI usually practice this drill for 2 to 3 minutes. \n\n4. Burst Shooting \n\n    These are the three drills that I practice before playing for the day. Other than these drills, one tip I can give you is depending on distance from your target, fire in bursts. At a close distance of 5 meters or so, it is perfectly fine to hold down left click. However, At a medium distance you should consider shooting in bursts of 5. At a medium distance, the first 5 bullets shot are perfectly straight. Notice in the video There is only one bullet hole until my gun shoots more than 5. At a long distance, this number is decreased to 4, where the fifth bullet is slightly off. \n\nEND \n\n    I hope these tips will help you become a player. Thanks for watching and if you enjoyed, please leave a like or a subscription so you can check out my new videos and I know my time was worth it. See you next time.\n\nSocial Media: \n\nhttps://www.twitter.com/BourneOW\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/BourneOW" </summary>

        <summary>b'Hey guys, this week\'s video will be a little more "advanced" than usual. I\'m going to be critiquing, analyzing, and reviewing my own Ana gameplay on Lijiang Tower in a lost solo queue game last week. The focus of the VOD review is to breakdown my own play, and what I could have done better in all situations to have improved my chances of winning this round, regardless of how my teammates played. Hope you guys enjoy it! \n\nMy Ana stats:\n\nhttps://www.overbuff.com/players/pc/KarQ-1811?mode=competitive\n\n\nWho am I? I\'m just a regular guy who loves video games and editing videos. Overwatch is the game of choice right now, and I will continue to do my best in putting out content that caters to an audience of all levels. Some videos will be basic guides while some will be high level gameplay/analysis. I play on PC on NA servers.\n\nS1: 71\nS2: 3.7k\nS3: 4.3k \n\n\nFollow me:\n\n Twitch:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/karq\n Youtube Gaming Stream: https://gaming.youtube.com/KarQGames/live\n Twitter: https://twitter.com/KarQGames\n Instagram: http://instagram.com/KarQGames\n\nBusiness Inquiries: KarQGaming@gmail.com\n\n\nMusic:\n\n Otis McDonald - Scarlet Fire https://youtu.be/8yOskhDn468\n\n Wild Flower by Joakim Karud https://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud\nCreative Commons  Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported CC BY-SA 3.0 \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...\nMusic provided by Audio Library https://youtu.be/AQWSIi1QU-o\n\n Martin Garrix - Oops https://youtu.be/8Aj_VPE7B9w' </summary>

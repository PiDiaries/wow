    <title>Tracer Ability Overview | Overwatch</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b'Time is on your side: http://bit.ly/MeetTracer\n\nLena Oxton (call sign "Tracer") was one of Overwatch\'s youngest and most promising pilots when an accident during a test flight left her lost in time. Only by wearing a chronal accelerator is Tracer able to stay anchored in the present. The device also allows her to manipulate her own time, speeding it up and slowing it down at will. \n\nArmed with twin pulse pistols, energy-based time bombs, and rapid-fire banter, Tracer is able to "blink" through space and rewind her personal timeline as she battles to right wrongs the world over. \n\nSign Up for Beta: http://bit.ly/JoinOverwatch \nLike Us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/playoverwatch \nFollow Us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/playoverwatch' </summary>

    <title>How I Mastered Tracer (And So Can You!) - Overwatch Guide #1</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b"Hey, everyone.  I am Fec of 87 Gaming, a huge Overwatch fan, and a Master Tracer player.\n\nAfter getting a ton of requests for tips and general advice for playing Tracer, I decided to make a guide.  I was really hesitant about this at first, as I am definitely not the best Tracer player in the world, and I have no experience making guides.  But the requests kept coming in, and I caved.\n\nI wanted to make something unique, though - not the same old thing you can find anywhere.  Instead of focusing on map tricks, or aiming style, or hero counters, I focused more on the general mentality and core skill set that I believe a Tracer player should focus on.  I wanted to share the things about Tracer that I have learned in my own personal experience, and what I believe elevated my own personal performance.  Ultimately, I created something that I felt would be far more useful to the average player; this guide is not for players who already top-tier and want to know how to become the next Saebyeolbe or Effect.  I am just an average player who climbed to Master using a few key strategies, in the hope that I can help others to do the same.\n\nI wrote over 4,000 words, and shared it online.  It resonated well with most people, so I decided to turn it into a video guide, and that's what this is.  I have never made a guide before, much less a full guide video, so please forgive the production value. It's just me talking to you about Tracer over some of my game play footage.\n\nYes, I play Overwatch on PS4.  Because this guide is far more about general mentality and rhythm than anything else, it should apply equally not only to all versions of the game, but all seasons and metas for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf you enjoy the video at all, or learned something new, don't forget to leave a comment.  And if you have some Tracer tips of your own, I would love to hear those, too.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe and come back to enjoy my Overwatch live streams!  I am always happy to answer questions or discuss anything Overwatch with the live chat.\n\nThank you so much for all of your support and encouragement, and I wish you the best of luck in your games.\n\n\nThe amazing thumbnail for this video was created by TuxcatvsWolf, check out his channel here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCURXKNAJdoTjEJm2taUN72Q\n\nDiscord:  https://discord.gg/YMCfNn4\nFacebook:  http://facebook.com/87GamingChannel/\nTwitter:  http://twitter.com/Eighty7Gaming" </summary>

    <title>SUREFOUR - GRANDMASTER TRACER GAMEPLAY TIPS | How To Improve As Tracer Guide - Overwatch Season 7</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b"Today we are back again trying a top 500 tip Tracer video because I think its fun and people just love Tracer it seems. Today we are talking about how the grandmaster Tracer player can carry his competitive games in season 7 overwatch competitive ranked mode guide for overwatch season 7 placement matches and overwatch season 7 changes. Going over some Tracer season 7 tips and guide or whatever you want to call it. I hope that these tips can help to have you guys learn how to improve as Tracer and hope this works as a mini Tracer guide tip trick thing for all that want to improve as her. Anyways, thanks! \n\n\n\n\nMore Videos! : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLefC4eOMnbRF5Xm7uCjfU73bh0ybup9Df\n\n\n\nGameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhp4VwmzDnE\nThumbnail: https://pre00.deviantart.net/8abb/th/pre/f/2016/159/0/b/cheers_luv_by_fenori-da5i4im.png\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n======================================================================\n\nTIPS I WROTE DOWN FROM THE VIDEO:\n-you can play tracer on offense/defense. And she has been viable for every meta aka best main ever\n-try to just use 1 blink to get around the map, or to dodge ablities. Saving 2 allows for outplays\n-get behind enemies on high ground,free poke and gives oppourtunity to 1 shot squishies\n-as tracer, start fighting as soon as your team goes in, but not next to your team. Go in flanking\n-spamming from high ground can charge ults, then just jump down go for it and e or go for a kill\n-try to get people off of the high ground,\n-use your ult whenever you see a chance to get a kill with it. Dont save unless zarya ult is almost ulp\n-stay next to enemy supports for most the game, force dps to turn around or let you free kill the supports\n-dont overextend for the supports in a teamfight, if they escape just headshot the tanks and reingage l8r\n-use blink to get behind the enemies in unconventional ways, try to not just blink 3 times into their backline\n-spawn camp when you are capping the point, or if you can get a pick early spawn camp to kill them agn\n\n-goes widow for the angle, tracer on first point defense here has to overextend too much aka not good\n-you want to play dive comp with tracer even on defense, just counterdive.\n-the purpose of dive comp is the tanks to take enemy attention and you kill the backline, position likewise\n-on defense he uses the highground and moving platforms to kill mercy from the side a few times\n-going ham after getting a few kills is worth it, staggering 1 or 2 kills gives you valued time\n-going through the enemy, turning around and shooting them, and then going though them again is OP\n-dont try to kill mercy when she is ulting, unless you can ult her just take out the other support/dps\n-tanks overextend a lot with mercy ult, if you see that you can often 2 clip tanks with teammate help\n-if you are already up 1 kill, then you can play teamfights more traditionally and fight next to your tanks\n-he pushes the enemy many times all the way to their spawn, goes with a zen orb though. dont go w/o\n-After spawn camping he and winston get a free flank, again showing the power of that\n-if the enemies have dps that can one shot you, dont go after them. Just go out of your way to avoid them\n\n\n\n======================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\nHow GRANDMASTER Players DESTORY with Tracer - Overwatch Top 500 PRO Tricks Overwatch - 20 TricksTracer Grandmasters ABUSE That You Don't!

Now she uses her great strength to protect her family, friends, and country.\n\nDeploying powerful personal barriers that convert incoming damage into energy for her particle cannon, Zarya is an invaluable asset on the front lines of any battle. When the enemy forces rally, a well-placed graviton surge can turn the tide of battle, drawing foes into its field and leaving them vulnerable.\n\nSign Up for Beta: http://bit.ly/JoinOverwatch \nLike Us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/playoverwatch \nFollow Us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/playoverwatch" </summary>

    <title>How to Use Zarya Bubbles Properly (lot of Guides get this WRONG)</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b'There\'s always going to be "better" bubbles you could\'ve hit.\nBut don\'t focus so hard on that. First focus on the more important stuff (positioning, map control, blocking CC), and after time and experience you\'ll start to hit those "clutch" bubbles naturally!\n\nThis video will give a guideline on how you should use bubbles so that you can concentrate on more important parts of Zarya gameplay. I know Masters players who got to their rank doing nothing but bubbling their main tank.\n\nA NOTE ABOUT ENERGY:\nIf you\'re following the guide, positioning as aggressively as possible using self-barrier as much as possible, and always getting a good opening bubble at the start of the fight, there should be no fight where you have less than 80 energy.\n\nMusic: Chris Brown - Don\'t Wake Me Up, TheFatRat Remix\n\nMy twitch: https://twitch.tv/cutefluffycats\n\nThanks to Nacho for helping me with the captions.' </summary>

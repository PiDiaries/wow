    <title>Reinhardt Ability Overview | Overwatch</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b'Justice will be done: http://bit.ly/MeetReinhardt\n\nOne of Overwatchs first and finest agents, Reinhardt Wilhelm styles himself as a champion of a bygone age. Though Overwatch was eventually disbanded, Reinhardt was not content to sit idly by while the world fell to disorder. Donning his Crusader siege armor, he has vowed to fight for justice like a knight of old, defending the innocent and winning hearts and minds with the promise of better days to come.\n\nWith his powerful hammer, Reinhardt leads rocket-propelled charges across the battlefield. He wades into the fray, crushing enemies into walls, bringing combatants to their knees, and defending his allies with a massive energy shield.\n\nSign Up for Beta: http://bit.ly/JoinOverwatch \nLike Us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/playoverwatch \nFollow Us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/playoverwatch' </summary>

    <title>Overwatch: Counter the STUN Meta! - Reinhardt Advanced Guide</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b"Reinhardt is both perhaps the most frustrating hero to play right now but also surprising one of the strongest heroes. Deathball and brawling is the way to go, but you also can easily get knocked in the face and focused down if you're not careful. In today's advanced guide, we break down the more important things to think about when playing up against the stun meta and what your goals should be when taking engagements. It is possible to outplay the stun meta rather than let it rekt you, but you have to know what you're playing for and try to set up beneficial teamfights, rather than simply stand in front and hope your team wins a poke war, Reinhardt has a job and if done wrong you can easily lose every teamfight and be left unsure what's going afoul.

        <summary>b"Reinhardt has one of the most impactful and crucial roles in Overwatch, yet despite that fact, a large % of players in the community are deathly afraid of his responsibilities. In this video, FREEDO breaks down the biggest carry plays Reinhardt can make and debatably the most important, initiating fights and getting money earthshatters. There are more skills to learn, but if you simply do those well, you'll be a massive tanking asset to your team and may pick up wins when you'd otherwise lose, especially when you don't have a capable Rein player handy on your team. \n\nSubscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/c/youroverwatch?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWe are YOUR OVERWATCH:\nTwitch - https://www.twitch.tv/youroverwatch \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/youroverwatchyt\nSubscribe - http://bit.ly/2aN1OuO\n\nDiscord Server:\nhttps://discordapp.com/invite/youroverwatch\n\nFREEDO's personal channel for Overwatch esports talk and more!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/xfreeedo" </summary>

        <summary>b"Entire google doc script: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BHy0fIYDEdlXiQ_FlGKTXuc49wIwLx2y7Rm2Il_sX6c/edit?usp=sharing\n\nDrift0r's video about armour in Overwatch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn297sIlKQk&index=0&\n[Didnt know YouTube removed annotations]\n\nStarting this project over 2 months ago, not having a lot of time to dedicate to it as I've been doing practice with my team 6 days a week plus school, this video has been re-edited countless times, script has been completely redrafted twice and re-recorded due to getting a better quality mic. Looking back on it I think I will drift away from reading from a script, not 100% sure yet. I definitely want to help people through vod reviews and I'll most likely make a video explaining it. Also the opinion at the end is semi-rushed and I hope it didn't come across as I like the state he is currently in. If I look back to the first few seasons there was only 1 person who could stun a reinhardt besides another rein which was flashbang, which has counterplay to it. This made him feel strong and powerful in game, now there are so many abilities to displace rein he feels more like a punching bag than something to fear. I would really like some stun resistance or knock-back distance resistance as it would make him much more fun again. Anyways once again thanks for watching and I hope you learned something or enjoyed the video. Let me know if you are confused about anything or if I haven't addressed a certain thing.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Awesomeness_OW\n\nMusic Credits: [Not in particular order]\nKevin MacLeod - AcidJazz\nRevolution Void - Someone Else's Memory\nKomiku - Action Epic\nJahzzar - Please Listen Carefully\nJahzzar - Candy\nJahzzar- DJ\nBroke For Free - Warm Up Suit\nDylan Tallchief - I tried making russian Hardbass [Sampled in outro]\n\nGame: Overwatch Blizzard Entertainment\nSampled clip from The Overwatch League\nEditing Software: Sony Vegas Pro 13\nRecording Software: Geforce Experience (Shadowplay)\nRecording Software [Mic]: Audacity\nPC Specs: who cares" </summary>

    <meta>
        <summary>b"Ever since Baptiste joined the Overwatch universe as hero 30 a lot of controversy surrounded him - from the lore that presented him as a changed man to how his playstyle should be and how OP or garbage tier he is.\n\nHis origin story was quickly completed with more information about his background in the last Overwatch mini event - BAPTISTES REUNION CHALLENGE, in which we got to see how Baptiste evolved into the present day and even a hint at the potential hero 31.\n\nConsidering he is a new hero everyone wants to find out how to play him and even rank up with him. Well if you're wondering the same then you are on the right video.\n\n\nI decided to do an EDUCATIONAL UNRANKED TO GM CHALLENGE with Baptiste and try my best to give you the information you need in order to rank up. I chose to make this challenge because the most asked questions in Twitch chat are regarding ranking up in competitive play, so I wanted to give you tips, the thought process and show you what you should be aware of when you're playing Baptiste (and supports in general). \n\nThis guide is mostly focused on gameplay and giving tips and tricks to the viewers while playing.\n\n Check out my video with Karq - ONE BAPTISTE TIP AGAINST EVERY HERO\nVideo link: https://youtu.be/fkM6nbxvchk\n\n Check out 7 tips on HOW TO USE BAPTISTE ULTIMATE:\nVideo link: https://youtu.be/xkdUdFIL3_I\n\n\n UNRANKED TO GM BAPTISTE ONLY\n EPISODE 2 - https://youtu.be/5Er6p3SImMI\n EPISODE 3 - https://youtu.be/V86X7KetBf4\n\nHit the  to join the notification squad!\n\n mL7s Socials:\n Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/mL7support\n Twitter: https://twitter.com/mL7support\n Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mL7support\n Discord: https://discord.gg/mL7\n\n PO BOX\nMihai Lupascu\nPO BOX 111, Postal Office Number 5 (Liberty Boulevard Number 1), Bucharest, Sector 5, Romania, Postal Code 040128\n\n Edit & Thumbnail by Denn\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dennied_\n\n\n Music by Ben Lepper - Light Rider (intro)\n Video Link: https://youtu.be/s6woPUtZ-hQ\n\n Music by: Dj Quads -  Dope (outro)\n Soundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads\n Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/djquads/\n Twitter - https://twitter.com/DjQuads" </summary>

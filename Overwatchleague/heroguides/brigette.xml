    <title>Overwatch: HUGE Brigitte NERF! - Secret Doomfist NERF?</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b"In this video we break down the forum post by Geoff Goodman that details a possible nerf to Brigitte's shield bash coming to the Overwatch PTR. Not being able to bully main tanks through barriers is a massive change to the game through key interactions and could herald a new meta at the pro level. Less Brig? More Tracer! For matchmaking players, Brig would still have a huge amount of value to go and get so it wouldn't delete her from the game, much to some people's either relief or regret. We also cover a potential stealth nerf to Doomfists slam from standing, which could make him that much more difficult to control.

    <title>Overwatch: Aggro Flanking Brigitte - Pro Duelist Playstyle</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b"A major part of Brigitte's strength is her capability to not only defend herself, but simply win 1v1s. Because of this, you can see Brigitte see a lot of use in the DPS slot playing in a duelist playstyle to either directly attack enemy damage or even flank the backline supports. Today's video we discuss the merits of going aggro into the backline especially when using Rally, which does more to enable Brigitte to chase down kills and survive herself, rather than simply armor up the team in a supportive way.

    <title>Genji Ability Overview | Overwatch</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b"I will never sacrifice my honor: http://blizz.ly/MeetGenji \n\nThe former son of the master of the Shimada ninja clan, Genji was almost slain in a disagreement with his brother Hanzo over their familys illegal businesses. On the brink of death, Overwatch saved his life by putting him through an extensive process of cyberization in exchange for his help in their operations against his familys empire. Once repulsed by the mechanical parts of his body, Genji has made peace with himself, and in doing so has discovered a higher humanity.\n\nGenji's new form enhanced his natural speed and agility and enhanced his superlative ninja skills. His main weapons are his arsenal of precise and deadly Shuriken, and his katana, which he uses to deflect incoming attacks. He utilizes his augmented abilities to climb walls, double jump, and deliver dashing Swift Strikes that leaves his foes bleeding. When the time comes for Genji to unleash his blade, he summons the dragon and can cut down enemies with a single slash.\n\nPre-Purchase Now: http://blizz.ly/BuyOverwatch \nSign-up for Beta: http://bit.ly/JoinOverwatch \nLike Us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/playoverwatch \nFollow Us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/playoverwatch" </summary>

    <title>Overwatch: Genji Counters EVERYTHING!</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b"It appears that many think Genji's strength fell alongside Tracer's in the Brigitte era however, Genji is much more powerful than you think, top tier in fact and it's because he's more effective at mobility positioning outplay and can afford to maintain as a threat on a flank, follow up on openings and close out fights with blade which charges relatively fast. In this video we discuss the most notable and expected exception, tanky Brigitte comps, who many assume would stun Genji into oblivion, but its with disciplined tank play and precise mid range poke harass that Genji excels. We don't cover what we assume to be obvious to everyone by now, Snipers or mid range immobile (farmable) heroes like Soldier or Widow are weak to Genji as well and obviously he's even in a dive mirror. Really, there's nothing you can run to outright stop solid Genji play right now because he has the tools to outplay everything, even his counters.

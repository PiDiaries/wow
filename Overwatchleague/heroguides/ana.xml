    <title>mL7 | HOW TO QUICKSCOPE WITH ANA IN OVERWATCH + TIPS (2018)</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b"Quickscoping is a really hard skill to master when you are playing Ana, but also extremely rewarding.\nIn today's video I take an in depth look into how to quick scope and the advantages / disadvantages of each type of shot you can do with Ana's gun - unscoped shots (also known as hip fire shots), scoped in shots and quick scopes. \nThe video is structured in two parts - the first part is about the technique of quickscoping (note that I have toggle scope on, so it might not be the same for the people with toggle scope off) and the second part is a detailed view on how to use Ana's gun in the best way possible in specific scenarios. \nIf you are interested on a guide about how to do the infamous quickscope or simply you want to learn more about how to use Ana's gun more effectively I strongly recommend you to watch today's video.\n\nHit the  to join the notification squad!\n\n\nmL7s Social:\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/ml7_ow\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/mL7ow\nDiscord: https://www.discord.gg/ml7\n\nEdit by Whisper\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/c/WhisperOW\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/whisper_ow\n\nThumbnail by Denn\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dennied_\n\n Music by: Dj Quads - Dope (intro)\nSoundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/djquads/\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/DjQuads\n Music by: KV - Look\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC_CHUwSBaw" </summary>

    <title>GALE - GRANDMASTER ANA BUFF GAMEPLAY TIPS | How To Improve As Ana Guide - Overwatch Season 7</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b'Today we are back again trying a top 500 tip Ana video because I think its fun and people just love Ana it seems. Today we are talking about how the grandmaster Ana player can carry his competitive games in season 7 overwatch competitive ranked mode guide for overwatch season 7 placement matches and overwatch season 7 changes. Going over some Ana season 7 tips and guide or whatever you want to call it. I hope that these tips can help to have you guys learn how to improve as Ana and hope this works as a mini Ana guide tip trick thing for all that want to improve as her. Anyways, thanks! \n\n\n\n\nMore Videos! : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLefC4eOMnbRF5Xm7uCjfU73bh0ybup9Df\n\n\n\nGameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpDhSZKQyRs\nThumbnail: https://img00.deviantart.net/b2d7/i/2016/217/1/2/captain_amari_by_jirakun-dacq9l8.jpg\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n======================================================================\n\nTIPS I WROTE DOWN FROM THE VIDEO:\n-Ana is now a really strong counter to mercy\n-ana moira allows for tripple/deathball to to heal up so much damage\n-think of her damage buff of more as a protective tool than an offensive one, but do take shots when free\n-ana is great in 2,2,2 and even works with 3,2,1\n-he heals mostly up pretty close, in non zoomed form\n-pushed up with his team and heals around corners\n-call our who you anti, its also counters moira so much \n-Ult the rein to allow a free opening in, but your dps to get actual real DPS \n-if you need to hit a clutch grenade and its kidna save, go in almost melee range\n-when your teammats are wining a fight, go for some damage trying to mainly kill enemy dps\n-dont go after mercy while she is ulting, your dps isnt enough to kill her\n-getting in close makes your damge and healing more consistant, but less safe. He takes the risk a lot\n\n-on defense he plays a lot further back and uses his scope a lot more\n-He always keeps an eye on highground to stop snipers/pharah\n-heal your 1hp targets first, then start healing tanks. Better to start healing tanks then top off dps sometim\n-when he cnt see any enemies, he just shoots healing darts on teammates, even if they have no damage\n-its ok if you dont hit every sleepdart, just make sure to go for a ton\n-your grenade is a great way to kill junkrats ult\n-spam healing on your mercy when she goes in for a res, make so that only burst can kill her\n-on defense, save your ult for  counterengage, dont just use it becaue its up\n\n-when his team is winning a teamfight he uses his sniper mode to finish off kills\n-just play safe and dont take any risks on defense\n\n-callout when you get somebody low and grenade them\n\n\n\n\n======================================================================\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is overwatch?: Well overwatch is Blizzards new take on the fps genre. In this game you choose a hero or "Class" to take on enemies, push payloads, and take control points. The point of the game is to beat the other team over and it is indeed a whole bunch of fun to play. The game includes 27 heroes so far and Is a blast to play. In this video I mostly go over playing it in a commentary type of manner, and these types of videos will usually be overwatch live commentaries or overwatch group commentaries. As well expect a few guides of this game in the future and some box openings as well. Anyways, hope you enjoy blizzards new hit!\'\n\nWho is JoeKing aka me. Im a overwatch youtuber that likes to talk about character updates, how to get better, and the competitive community. Trying to help you get better at overwatch and entertain at the same time hopefully.

        <summary>b"Sombra after a handful of buffs is now going to be a force to be reckoned with and a hero you should consider putting into your hero pool. With a shifty backline harass playstyle along with a devastating ultimate when used correctly, Sombra can be a gamechanger and with a 4s cooldown on Translocator you should have the tools to take the positioning and stay alive to make an impact with Sombra.

    <title>Overwatch: Sombra Counters EVERYTHING! - Advanced Guide</title>
    <meta>
        <summary>b"Sombra has found herself as one of the most reliable damage heroes in Overwatch if you know the tricks of her playstyle to be an obnoxious disruptor that bars the enemy team from playing the video game. Every flanker and just about every tank fears Sombra's ability to be untouchable while still getting impact in the fight and today we focus on two core skillsets of Sombra to help do this. Movement is an underrated aspect of Overwatch skill and most of Sombra's value will come from getting better at movement so you do more razzle dazzle and less full retreats away from fights. Otherwise, timing engages WITH your team to get value out of your emps is the key, and today we show off some in game comms of how this gets accomplished.

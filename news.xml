Team USA and Team Canada will advance to the Overwatch World Cup Finals at BlizzCon.

Both teams secured their BlizzCon spot before their match today, however it remained an important match to determine final seeding for the stage, which then influences the draw for the matches at BlizzCon.

At BlizzCon, the Quaterfinals will feature a first seed from each of the Group Stages going up against a second seed from the Group Stages. This means that the first seeds from each stage will avoid playing each other until at least the Semi-Finals, presuming they make it that far.

Team USA secured that top seed of the Los Angeles Group Stage in a 3-1 victory over Team Canada in the final match of the stage. This means that USA will avoid playing South Korea in the Quaterfinals, and will instead face a second seed team from one of the other stages.

Canada finished the stage 4-1, and hadnâ€™t lost a single map prior to their match against USA.

Team USA, meanwhile, finished the stage 5-0, and only dropped two maps total.

This Group Stage also marked the professional return of popular streamer and main tank xQc, playing for Team Canada, after he mutually parted ways with the Dallas Fuel in Season One of the Overwatch League.

The Overwatch World Cup continues next weekend with the Bangkok Group Stage. Teams Australia, Sweden, China, Spain, Denmark and Thailand will fight for two spots at BlizzCon.

The final Group Stage will be played at Paris the weekend after that, featuring Teams France, United Kingdom, Germany, Netherlands, Poland and Italy.

The Overwatch World Cup Finals will be played at BlizzCon on November 2-3.
